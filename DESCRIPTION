Description: Create high-performance clinical reporting tables (TLGs) from
    ADaM-like inputs. The package provides a consistent, programmatic API
    to generate common tables such as demographics, adverse event incidence,
    and laboratory summaries, using 'data.table' for fast aggregation over
    large populations. Functions support flexible target-variable selection,
    stratification by treatment, and customizable summary statistics, and
    return tidy, machine-readable results ready to render with downstream
    table/formatting packages in analysis pipelines.
